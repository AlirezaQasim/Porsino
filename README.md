Project Name
This is a full-stack web application with a ReactJS frontend and a Node.js/Express.js backend. The frontend is built using Create React App, and the backend is powered by Node.js with Express.js for API routing and server management.
Project Structure
The project is organized into two main directories:

frontend/: Contains the ReactJS application.
backend/: Contains the Node.js/Express.js server.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
npm (comes with Node.js)

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
cd backend
npm install

Start the backend server:
npm start

The backend server runs on http://localhost:8080 by default. Check backend/package.json for specific scripts and backend/.env for configuration (e.g., port, database settings).
3. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
cd frontend
npm install

Available Frontend Scripts
In the frontend/ directory, you can run:

npm start: Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page reloads on code changes, and lint errors appear in the console.
npm test: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See running tests for more information.
npm run build: Builds the app for production to the build folder. It bundles React in production mode, optimizes the build, and minifies files with hashed filenames. See deployment for more information.
npm run eject: Note: This is a one-way operation. Removes the single build dependency and copies configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) for full control. Use with caution, as you can't revert. See Create React App documentation for details.

4. Connecting Frontend and Backend
The frontend communicates with the backend via API calls using fetch or axios. The backend exposes RESTful endpoints (e.g., /api/*) on http://localhost:5000. Ensure the backend server is running before starting the frontend.
To configure the API base URL:

In the frontend, set the API URL in frontend/src/config.js or use environment variables (e.g., .env file with REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000).
Example API call in React:fetch(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/api/example`)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));



5. Running the Full Application

Start the backend server (cd backend && npm start).
In a separate terminal, start the frontend (cd frontend && npm start).
Open http://localhost:3000 to interact with the application.
